# Rust exercises
## Current version 1.0.0 (OCW 601 SC - Unit 1 Session 1)
The purpose of this repo is to learn Rust while at the same time applying the exercises from the course.
Some of the exercises are solved by Rust-ifying the suggested Python solution.

The Exercises are taken from [MIT OpenCourseWare Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/index.htm)
